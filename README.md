# CP-PDWOA
For the insufficiency of the original WOA algorithm search mechanism, we modified it based on the original code.
1）It should be noted that this article has been modified based on the original WOA algorithm.
2）We added perturbation ideas to the algorithm，
3）We discussed the impact of the search path on the algorithm
4）When you run WOA you can see the optimization effect of a single function
5）The comparison of all experiments is in the result（a folder ）
